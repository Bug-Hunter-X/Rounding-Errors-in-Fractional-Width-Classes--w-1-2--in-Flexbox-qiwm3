```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
</div>
```
This code snippet intends to create a flex container with two equally sized divs. However, due to rounding errors in the `w-1/2` class, the two divs might not perfectly occupy 50% of the width each, leading to a small gap or overlap depending on the parent container's width.
